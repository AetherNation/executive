# Decree of 24 January 12021

By decree of Aetherlord Jacob Haap, the Aether Nation is placed into a temporary state of absolute monarchy. The state of absolute monarchy shall last until the population of the Aether Nation (the total combined number of residents and citizens) hits 50.

This decree is made so that until we have sustained a population needed for the creation of a legislative body, government activity can take place. Without a legislative body, the lawmaking process as outlined in the Constitution is unable to take place. This decree places all legislative power in the executive branch of government until the population threshold has been met. All of my activities during this time will be strictly in line with the Constitution, subject to verification by the Grand Sage of the Aether Sages. During this time, no amendments are permitted to be made to the Constitution.

Once the population has surpassed 50, this decree expires and the legislative power shall return to the legislative branch. At that time, we will have a high enough population to hold our first democratic election, meaning the House of Elementals will be in session shortly after.

This act of the executive branch of government is put into effect immediately, made official by the Aetherlord on this 24th day of January, Twelve Thousand Twenty-One.
